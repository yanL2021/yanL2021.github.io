## 0.1 Programming Background

I have some experience with SAS before taking this course. Compared to
SAS, R allows you more flexibility during programming. You always have
multiple ways to achieve the goal. However, the structure of SAS coding
is more. The best part of R is that there are various packages to help
your coding. Also, R is much easier to share with others since it is
completely free. For SAS, you can only use it on the computers from an
institution that has bought the software. But this property of SAS makes
the programs run more stable than R due to the maintaining effort from
the company. SAS code is also easier to follow than R since it always
follows a similar structure and logic flow. I won’t consider R as a
difficult language to learn, but it will take a lot of effort before you
master it.
