I donâ€™t think there is a big change about what I think a data scientist is. However, after this course, I have a better picture of what data scientists do in their work including data collecting, cleaning, modeling, and presenting. I will continue to use R going forward. It is a powerful tool with numerous packages for the steps I mentioned above. I  would say this course is the best one in my program in terms of learning practical skills in future Data Science related works. I will do differently in practice from many aspects. I listed several of them below. I will present my work with a shiny app instead of PPT slides. I can discuss and share my work with others through Github instead of sending codes by email. I will use Rmarkdown to generate a report instead of typing and pasting things in Word.
