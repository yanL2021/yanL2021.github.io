## Explaination

Online News Popularity Data Set summarizes a heterogeneous set of
features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years.
The goal of this project is to predict the number of shares in social
networks (popularity). Here we first showed some summary statistics and
plots about the data grouped by weekdays. Then we create several models
to predict the response, shares in different channels.

## Thoughts

During this project, the most difficult part is to coordinate the
progress of the project with the group partner. I usually prefer to
start the work early and do a little everyday. However, other people may
have some situation and prefer to work in a different pace. Next time, I
probably would try to communicate with my group partner better, and set
a more clear timeline of working progress (It may also not helpfulâ€¦). I
feel we did many things in a hurry during the last two days. In
addition, I learned a lot from this process about prediction with
different methods. The way of plan and thinking when getting a new data
set. I also read a lot about the model selection which definitely gave
me a more clear picture of predication.
